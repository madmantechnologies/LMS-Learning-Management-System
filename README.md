# LMS-Learning-Management-System
The Learning Management System (LMS) is a type of technology that allows you to manage every aspect of the learning process. It's where you keep, display, and track your training materials. This concept is intertwined with e-Learning. Learning management systems make up the largest segment of the learning market.
